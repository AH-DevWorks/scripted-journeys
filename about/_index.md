Hi, I'm Alex Huang, the creator of this website.
This is my little space on the internet where I share thoughts, moments, and personal program projects.
I enjoy coding, learning, and sometimes writing late-night reflections.
If you find any of this interesting, feel free to stick around.
You can reach me through the contact page if you have questions or just want to say hi. Thanks for stopping by!

嗨，可以叫我 Alex ，這裡是我用 Github + Hugo 架設的靜態網站，不定期更新一些我的程式學習歷程、專案跟一些生活隨筆。
